            <h1>Overview NOAA IOOS Data Integration Framework</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>					
<p>The NOAA IOOS program initiated development of a Data  Integration Framework  (DIF) to  improve management and delivery of an initial subset of ocean  observations. The DIF will establish the  technical infrastructure, standards, and protocols needed to improve delivery  of atleast six of <a href="http://www.csc.noaa.gov/cir/files/Core.Variables.from.IOOSPlan_FIN_low-res%2033.pdf" target="_blank">20 IOOS core oceanographic variables</a>  defined in the U.S. IOOS Development Plan, as well as winds. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOAA will complete initial development of the DIF in 2010, providing seven IOOS variables from multiple observing system data sources in consistent formats expected to achieve  improvements in a select set of NOAA's decision-support tools. To achieve an effective system design that  results in measurable improvements in these tools, NOAA must first understand  the specific data needs associated with the four decision-support tools (discussed in the <em>Enhancing NOAA's Decision Products</em> section below). The NOAA IOOS program asked developers/users of the four data products to define their specific  data requirements associated with an initial set of core variables, as well as  other IOOS core variables critical to improve to NOAA&rsquo;s models and  predictions. The program will use this  information to help design the DIF and to ensure future system enhancements and expansion  beyond the initial core variables develop according to the user needs.</p>

	<h5><a name="core">IOOS Variables </a></h5>
	<br />	
			
				<p>NOAA chose to focus its initial integration efforts on seven IOOS variables describing ocean and coastal conditions: </p>
				<br />
				<ul id="list">
                  <li>Seawater Temperature; </li>
				  <li>Salinity; </li>
				  <li>Water/Sea level; </li>
				  <li>Currents;</li>
				  <li>Ocean color;</li>
			      <li>Waves; and</li>
				  <li>Winds </li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<br />
				<p>These seven variables were selected for their maximum ability to achieve improvements in four  of NOAA's decision tools, discussed below.&nbsp;  However, these data are also important for a wide range of scientific applications.&nbsp; At a very basic level, measurements of how  warm or cold the water is or how much salt is in the water can have significant  impacts on the organisms that live in our oceans.&nbsp; For example, coral reefs are highly sensitive  to changes in temperature and can become bleached if temperatures become too  warm.&nbsp;Sea water also impacts development of hurricanes. </p>

				<p>Water-level measurements are used to monitor and predict the expected location and severity of coastal flooding and storm surge impacts. On a day-to-day basis, these data provide  timely measurements of local tides, which are of great importance to the shipping industry, among others. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Measurements of the speed and direction of water flows can be used to track  the movement of coastal pollutants and oil spills. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is also able to  use surface current data in its search and rescue operations, as this  information allows the USCG to narrow its search radius by identifying which  direction a ship in distress may have drifted.&nbsp; </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>Ocean color allows scientists to monitor the presence and concentration of  phytoplankton in surface waters when a large quantity of these organisms is  concentrated in an area. The resulting plankton  &quot;bloom&quot; alters the color of the ocean surface and scientists can observe these  changes in color from satellite imagery. Most phytoplankton species are not  harmful and provide a food source for other marine organisms.&nbsp; However, some  species are quite toxic and can cause beach and shellfish closures. It is  important to monitor for these &quot;harmful algal blooms&quot; to mitigate potential  public health impacts.</p>
  &nbsp;              
			  <p>Wave speed and  direction help mariners, recreational boaters and fishermen determine boating  conditions and are crucial to know for search and rescue operations.&nbsp; Waves influence dispersal of pollutants and  affect the amount of water that can be expected during a storm.
			  </p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>       
			  <p>Finally, wind measurements are  important for many applications, including weather forecasting, movement of  pollutants, search and rescue operations, and determining where hurricanes are  tracking.&nbsp; Winds are also important for tracking  harmful algal blooms because winds can disperse those blooms.&nbsp; In addition, winds drive ocean conditions  that influence behaviors and distributions of marine species, making the  information important for fishermen and resource managers alike.</p>

				<p>Decision-support  tools and models used to predict hurricane intensity, coastal flooding, and harmful  algal blooms, and to develop integrated ecosystem assessments were targeted as  the initial areas of emphasis for NOAA&rsquo;s IOOS efforts. These four decision tools were selected because  they represent high-priority NOAA efforts that align well with many of the  societal goals described in the U.S. IOOS Development Plan. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>As  an example, the seven IOOS  variables play key roles in predicting  hurricane intensity. When a hurricane is  threatening landfall, emergency  officials making evacuation decisions rely on predictions from scientists on  how quickly an approaching hurricane will increase in intensity.&nbsp; Because hurricanes  tend to strengthen over warmer water, these scientists require access to as  much high-quality and compatible sea surface temperature data as possible in  the predicted path of the storm.&nbsp; IOOS  provides the connections among national and regional observing systems to  deliver these data.</p>
