            <h1>Information and Technical Documenation from the DIF Project - NOAA IOOS Data Integration Framework</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NOAA IOOS program initiated development of a Data  Integration Framework  (DIF) to  improve management and delivery of an initial subset of ocean  observations. The DIF will establish the  technical infrastructure, standards, and protocols needed to improve delivery  of atleast six of <a href="http://www.csc.noaa.gov/cir/files/Core.Variables.from.IOOSPlan_FIN_low-res%2033.pdf" target="_blank">20 IOOS core oceanographic variables</a> defined in the U.S. IOOS Development Plan, as well as winds. <a href="../ioos_in_action/overview.html"><em style="font-size:10px">Read More</em></a></p>

<ul id="list"><h4><a name="dataaccess">Data Access</a></h4>
The following services are the first to be established by the NOAA IOOS program and its partners to provide access to data.
	<li> <a href="http://sdf.ndbc.noaa.gov/sos/" target="_blank">NDBC Sensor Observation Service (SOS)</a> This server provides in-situ temperature, salinity, currents, water level, waves and winds data
from National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) moorings, IOOS Regional Coastal Ocean Observing Systems, Deep-ocean Assessment and
Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoys, and Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) buoys. The server is
operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) NDBC. SOS is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard. </li>
	<li> <a href="http://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/ioos-dif-sos/" target="_blank">CO-OPS SOS</a> This server provides in-situ temperature, conductivity, currents, water level, and waves data
from the National Water Level Observing Network (NWLON) and the Physical Oceanographic Real-Time
System (PORTS). The server is operated by the NOAA National Ocean Service (NOS) Center for
Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS).</li>
	<li> <a href="http://sdf.ndbc.noaa.gov/wcs/" target="_blank">NDBC THREDDS Data Server (TDS)</a> &nbsp;This server provides gridded surface currents derived from high-frequency radar (HFR) installations
along the coasts. The server supports Web Coverage Service (WCS) and  Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OpenDAP) and is operated by NDBC. WCS is an OGC standard.</li>
	<li><a href="http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/sos/difSOS.html" target="_blank">SECOORA SOS</a> This server provides a variety of in-situ parameters from a collection   of data providers.&nbsp; Server is operated by SECOORA (Southeast Coastal   Ocean Observing Regional Association). Software documentation on   creating this service from the supporting database is at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xenia/wiki/XeniaSOS" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/xenia/wiki/XeniaSOS</a></li>
	<li><u>CoastWatch TDS (coming soon!)</u> This server will provide access to chlorophyll concentrations derived from satellite ocean color observations.
(Expected November 2008). This server is operated by NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) CoastWatch program.</li>

application schema defines the XML encoding used by the NDBC and CO-OPS SOS to
serve in situ data.  This encoding is designed to be complete
and machine-readable, and may be transformed to simplified representations
using code such as the Extensible Styleheet Language Transformation (XSLT) example below.</li>
	<li><strong>Text encoding:</strong> IOOS conventions for <a href="/library/ioos_conventions_for_csv_encoding_v100c.pdf" target="_blank">comma-separated value (CSV)</a> (PDF, 84kB) and <a href="/library/ioos_conventions_for_tsv_encoding_v100c.pdf" target="_blank">tab-separated value (TSV)</a> (PDF, 95kB) encoding. CSV and TSV are offered by the NDBC SOS and eventually by other IOOS SOS.
The CSV is directly readable by common spreadsheet programs. The TSV includes a few specialized column headers to make it more easily readable by the <a target="_blank" href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/redirout.cgi?url=http://odv.awi.de/">Ocean Data View (ODV)</a> software package.
